Exercise 1

1) Study the implementation by promises.js and observables.js as well as the corresponding unit-tests.

2) Implement a new class Service doing the exact same thing than the Service implemented by promises.js or observables.js, but now do it using async/await

3) Compare and discuss the three solutions:
    - readability, testability, maintainability, performance, ... or other aspects ?
    - advantages, disadvantages, ...
    - ...

4) Although the unit-tests seem to work fine, why are they really really bad ?
    - What is the problem with the tests ?
    - Analyse and discuss
    - How would/could you fix them ?

HINTS:
- You're not allowed to replace and/or manipulate any definitions/declarations contained by the file simulate.js
- In order to complete this exercise you don't need to know the details about Observables. We will discuss them later ...
